# tkv-project

A simple online multiplayer Blackjack game made for the ELEC-C7241 - Computer Networks (5 cr) course project by Esa Koskinen and Felipe Gonzalez Carceller.

When in project's root directory, you can use `. build.sh` to compile and build the application. To run the server you can use ´. runserver.sh´and for the client you can use ´. runclient.sh'. You can also manually clean with `rm -r bin/*`, compile with `javac -sourcepath src/ -d bin src/tkv_project/*/*.java`, run the server with `java -cp bin/ tkv_project.server.ServerLauncher`, and run the client with ´java -cp bin/ tkv_project.client.ClientLauncher´. For more detailed instructions, see documentation.
